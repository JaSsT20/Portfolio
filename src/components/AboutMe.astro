      My name is Jasson Levid Tejada Mart√≠nez, but my friends call me
      Levid. I began programming independently, creating simple apps with
      Windows Forms and scripting for MultiTheftAuto using Lua. Currently, I am <strong
        >finishing my degree in Systems and Computing Engineering</strong
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of my notable experiences include <strong
        >participating in the ICPC in 2022 with the team 'No-Name' and 2023 with
        'C-Bao'</strong
      >. Although we didn't qualify for the subsequent rounds, it was a
      enriching experience that helped me learn a lot.

      At this stage of my life, I have leaned more towards web development,
      experimenting with different technologies in an environment where I felt
      comfortable, such as Blazor, as it uses C# and Razor, languages I was
      already familiar with. However, I have also decided to step out of that
      comfort zone and learn new technologies like JavaScript, TypeScript,
      React, Astro, etc.
